# Parkin_group_electrochemistry_plotting
Some code to plot multiple electrochemistry files for the Parkin group. To run, you will need git, python and the python package installer pip. 

Once you have installed these, use the command line to navigate to the directory you want to save the plotting functions and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/HOLL95/Parkin_group_electrochemistry_plotting/
```
navigate into the cloned directory and run:

```
python3 -m pip install r requirements.txt
```
which should provide the modules you need. The plotting is done from the master_plotting.py file, which provides a description of how to load files, and what the various options do. To run:
```
python3 master_plotting.py
```
